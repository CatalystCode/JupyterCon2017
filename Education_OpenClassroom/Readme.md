# Demo 1 - Using Cognitive Services API within Jupyter Notebooks
Microsoft Cognitive Services let you build apps with powerful algorithms to see, hear, speak, understand and interpret using natural methods of communication, with just a few lines of code. Easily add intelligent features, such as emotion and sentiment detection, vision and speech recognition, language understanding, knowledge and search. The following demos are to demonstrate how cognitive services can be introduced using Jupyter Notebooks.

see the following [Cognitive API Demos](http://aka.ms/CognitiveNotebooks) 

## Demo [Cognitive+Services+Translation.ipynb](https://notebooks.azure.com/LeeStott-Microsoft/libraries/CogPy/html/Cognitive+Services+Translation.ipynb) 

Uses the Microsoft Cognitive Text Transalator API to transalate convert text from one language to another - this show practical use of Jupyter Python Notebooks in course such as lingutics.

## Demo [FaceDetectionAPI.ipynb](https://notebooks.azure.com/LeeStott-Microsoft/libraries/CogPy/html/FaceDetectionAPi.ipynb) 

Uses the Microsoft Cognitive Face Detection API to identify the following attitirbutes
https://azure.microsoft.com/en-gb/services/cognitive-services/face/ 

- Face Attributes 
- Age
- Emotion
- Gender
- HeadPose
- FaceRectangle

Examples of Usage include
- Face verification
Check the likelihood that two faces belong to the same person. The API will return a confidence score of how likely it is that the two faces belong to one person.
- Face detection
Detect one or more human faces in an image and get back face rectangles for where in the image the faces are, along with face attributes that contain machine learning-based predictions of facial features. The face attribute features available are: Age, Emotion, Gender, Pose, Smile and Facial Hair, along with 27 landmarks for each face in the image.
